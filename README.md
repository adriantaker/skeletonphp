This is a "SKELETON" structure for files (or filesystem) for my own PHP applications.
It is based on the psd/skeleton package (https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton) but
adpated to what I(AdriÃ¡n) thought was better for my projects.

If the name of the app(src reference) is changed in composer.json "composer install" must
be executed to re-generate the autoload files and also it must be changed in all the
namespaces where it was used.

|The documentation shown below is copied from the psd/skeleton's README.md file.|

## Summary

| If a package has a root-level directory for ... | ... then it MUST be named: |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| command-line executables                        | `bin/`                     |
| configuration files                             | `config/`                  |
| documentation files                             | `docs/`                    |
| web server files                                | `public/`                  |
| logs, cache, etc files                          | `var/`                  |
| other resource files                            | `resources/`               |
| PHP source code                                 | `src/`                     |
| test code                                       | `tests/`                   |

A package MUST use these names for these root-level files:

| If a package has a root-level file for ...      | ... then it MUST be named: |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| a log of changes between releases               | `CHANGELOG(.*)`            |
| guidelines for contributors                     | `CONTRIBUTING(.*)`         |
| licensing information                           | `LICENSE(.*)`              |
| information about the package itself            | `README(.*)`               |

A package SHOULD include a root-level file indicating the licensing and
copyright terms of the package contents.

## Root-Level Directories

### bin/

named `public/`.

This publication does not otherwise define the structure and contents of the

> N.b.: This directory MAY be intended as a web server document root.

> that they become publicly available on the web.

### resources/

If the package provides a root-level directory for other resource files, it MUST
be named `resources/`.

This publication does not otherwise define the structure and contents of the
directory.

### src/

If the package provides a root-level directory for PHP source code files, it
MUST be named `src/`.

This publication does not otherwise define the structure and contents of the
directory.

### tests/

If the package provides a root-level directory for test files, it MUST be named
`tests/`.

This publication does not otherwise define the structure and contents of the
directory.

### Other Directories

The package MAY contain other root-level directories for purposes not described
by this publication.

This publication does not define the structure and contents of the other
root-level directories.

## Root-Level Files

### CHANGELOG

If the package provides a root-level file with a list of changes since the last
release or version, it MUST be named `CHANGELOG`.

It MAY have a lowercase filename extension indicating the file format.

This publication does not otherwise define the structure and contents of the
file.

### CONTRIBUTING

If the package provides a root-level file that describes how to contribute to

It MAY have a lowercase filename extension indicating the file format.

This publication does not otherwise define the structure and contents of the

### LICENSE

Whereas package consumers might be in violation of copyright law when copying

indicating the licensing and copyright terms of the package contents.

If the package provides a root-level file indicating the licensing and copyright
terms of the package contents, it MUST be named `LICENSE`.

It MAY have a lowercase filename extension indicating the file format.

This publication does not otherwise define the structure and contents of the
